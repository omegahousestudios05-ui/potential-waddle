# Sonic AI v3

Sonic AI is a producer-focused platform for storing audio assets, extracting deterministic metadata, searching a personal vault, tracking creative activity, and building a producer profile from real uploads.

Sprint 1 intentionally excludes AI generation, autonomous agents, embeddings, and DSP-heavy analysis. The goal is a stable foundation that supports sign-in, projects, uploads, metadata, search, activity history, and automatic profile aggregation.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 10+
- Python 3.12+ for the future FastAPI app
- PostgreSQL 15+ for the future database layer

## Setup

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

## Current status

The repository is in Sprint 1 bootstrap/planning state. The monorepo workspace is initialized, and the next implementation step is the FastAPI foundation described in `docs/planning/sprint-1-implementation-backlog.md`.

## Sprint 1 scope

End-to-end Sprint 1 success means:

- User signs in with Supabase Auth.
- User creates projects.
- User uploads audio files to local disk storage.
- Asset records are stored in PostgreSQL.
- Deterministic metadata is generated automatically.
- Vault search filters assets by metadata.
- - Activity history records user actions.
- Producer profile aggregates uploads automatically.
